# About
My response to a really fun coding challenge.

Luke Skywalker has vanished. With the support of the republic, General Leia Organa leads a brave resistance. Rumours have spread that Luke sent the droid R2-D2 on a secret reconnaissance mission to Korriban at the outer rim of the galaxy. General Organa has tasked the resistance engineering team to develop a software system capable of communicating with probe droids.

I had previously discovered domain driven design and onion architecture amonst other things and used the excercise to continue evolving my approach. The application uses KVO, Speech framework to command the droids.

The Commlink button in the lower right corner is used to issue the commands. The action is touch, speak, release.

The command to summon a droid:
Droid number (number?)

The command to relocate a droid within a 1000x1000 grid:
Move to x (number?) y (number?)
